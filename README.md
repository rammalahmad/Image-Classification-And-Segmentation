# Image Classification and Segmentation for Well Detection  
üèÜ **Second Prize Winner** at McKinsey's QuantumBlack Hackathon, √âcole Polytechnique  

---

## Overview  
This project showcases an **image classification and segmentation pipeline** for detecting wells in desert regions. Using **pretrained ResNet** for classification and **UNet** for segmentation, the models were trained on labeled data provided by QuantumBlack. The results were deployed in a **Flask-based web app**, developed within the two-day hackathon. The project secured **2nd place**.
